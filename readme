#Algorithms project
#Data should be placed in the data folder and all the generated outputs will also store in the data folder.
#Conversion from ascii-binary-ascii and Image compression using SVD and Error calculations are coded in Java.
#Java files used - SVD.java, Utils.java and DecomposeMatrix.java.
#SVD is our main java class which separates the given tasks.
#DecomposeMatrix class in DecomposeMatrix.java file decomposes the given matrix into U,S,VT and saves the header.txt and SVD.txt
#Utils.java file has the few methods like saveCompressedFileToBin, readCompressedBin, convertFloatToHalfPrecision.
#Note -- PGM file should not have comment line.

Firstly step is to compile all the java files. This can be done by executing the command given below
----- javac -cp .:jblas.jar *.java

1st task: Convert ASCII image to binary image. This can be done by executing the command given below
----- java -cp .:jblas.jar SVD 1 image.pgm
program will use binary coding to save all necessary information in your asci pgm image. 
Used 2 bytes to save the wide of the image and 2 bytes to save the height of the image; 
used one byte for the grey scale levels; and use one byte for the grey level of each pixel.
Output saved as image_b.pgm 

2nd task: convert binary to ASCII image.This can be done by executing the command given below.
----- java -cp .:jblas.jar SVD 2 image_b.pgm
Output saved as image_copy.pgm.

3rd task: To decompose the matrix and getting image_header.txt and image_svd.txt. This can be done by executing the command given below
----- java -cp .:jblas.jar DecomposeMatrix image.pgm
Output saved as image_header.txt and image_SVD.txt

4th task: This task compress the image and then converts into binary file. This can be done by executing the command given below.
----- java -cp .:jblas.jar SVD 3 image_header.txt image_SVD.txt rank
The header.txt contains 3 integers (width, height, grey scale levels). SVD.txt contains 3 matrices.
Output saved as image_b.pgm.SVD. 

5th task: To recover the image. This can be done by executing the command given below.
----- java -cp .:jblas.jar SVD 4 image_b.pgm.SVD
Output saved as image_rank.pgm

6th task: Error Calculations. This can be done by executing the command given below.
java -cp .:jblas.jar SVD 5 baboon.pgm baboon_80.pgm baboon_b.pgm.SVD
Outputs are THE RATE OF COMPRESSION AND MEAN SQUARE ERROR.

#PCA was done by using jupyter notebook in python.
# before running the jupyter notebook. -- REQUIREMENTS (python version 3+, and install packages by pip install pandas, jupyter, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy)
# To run the jupyter notebook visuals.py and data.csv should be in the same folder.
# In command line run code jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb and Run each cell from the beginning (shift+enter).
